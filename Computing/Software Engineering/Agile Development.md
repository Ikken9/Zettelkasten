# Agile Development

The **Agile development process** is an iterative, flexible approach where work is divided into short cycles called **sprints** (1–4 weeks). Each sprint delivers a working product increment. Teams collaborate closely with stakeholders, continuously gather feedback, and adapt to changing requirements. Testing and development happen concurrently, ensuring continuous delivery of high-quality software. Key Agile principles include customer collaboration, frequent releases, and team autonomy.

The Agile development process typically follows these steps:

1. **Product Backlog Creation**: Define and prioritize a list of features or user stories.
2. **Sprint Planning**: Select tasks from the backlog to complete in the upcoming sprint (1–4 weeks).
3. **Sprint**: Develop, test, and deliver working product increments during the sprint.
4. **Daily Stand-ups**: Hold brief daily meetings to track progress and address blockers.
5. **Sprint Review**: Present the completed work to stakeholders for feedback.
6. **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on the sprint to identify improvements for the next one.
7. **Repeat**: Start the next sprint, adjusting priorities based on feedback and evolving requirements. 

This cycle continues until the product is complete.
