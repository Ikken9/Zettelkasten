# Artifacts

In software development, a software artifact is an item that is produced during the development process. This can be a data model, a prototype, workflow diagram, a design document, or a setup script. In fact, there are specific artifacts that are required during a development cycle – and these need to be stored in an accessible manner.

*"In UML models, artifacts are model elements that represent the physical entities in a software system. Artifacts represent physical implementation units, such as executable files, libraries, software components, documents, and databases."*
