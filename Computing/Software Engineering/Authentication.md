# Authentication

Authentication is the critical process to secure access to a system, verifying the identity of users or devices.
It is the process of verifying whether a subject is really who they say they are, based on secret information or other security factors.



## **Authentication Mechanisms**

#### **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**
Is a set of open protocols used to access centrally stored information over a network.
LDAP is commonly used for centrally managed users and groups, user authentication, or system configuration.

#### **SSO (Single Sign-On)**
Is a technology which combines several different application login screens into one. With SSO, a user only has to enter their login credentials (username, password, etc.) one time on a single page to access all of their SaaS applications.

#### **Auth0**
Is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications.
It works as a SaaS.
