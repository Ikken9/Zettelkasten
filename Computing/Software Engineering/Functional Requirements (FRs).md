# Functional Requirements

These are the requirements that the end user specifically demands as basic facilities that the system should offer. All these functionalities need to be necessarily incorporated into the system as a part of the contract.

These are represented or stated in the form of input to be given to the system, the operation performed and the output expected. They are the requirements stated by the user which one can see directly in the final product, unlike the non-functional requirements.

Software engineers describe functional requirements as a system function or component, where the functions define the intended behavior between inputs and outputs.

In other words, you can define functional requirements as the systemâ€™s basic behaviors.
