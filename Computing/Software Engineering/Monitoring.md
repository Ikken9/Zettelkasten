# Monitoring

**Monitoring** in the context of software engineering or IT infrastructure is the process of continuously observing and tracking the performance, behavior, and health of a system, application, or network in real time. Its primary goal is to detect, log, and analyze events or metrics to ensure the system functions properly and to identify potential problems before they impact users or cause failures.

### Components of Monitoring:

1. **Metric Collection**: Data is gathered on various performance aspects, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, response times, error rates, etc. These metrics provide crucial insights into system health.

2. **Alerts**: Monitoring systems can be set to trigger alerts when specific metric thresholds are breached. For example, if CPU usage exceeds 90%, the system can notify administrators to take action.

3. **Data Visualization**: Monitoring tools often include dashboards that visualize key metrics in charts and graphs, making it easy to track system status in real time.

4. **Logs**: Events happening within the system, such as errors or exceptions, are recorded in log files. Log monitoring is essential for troubleshooting and audits.

5. **Analysis**: Historical data is analyzed to identify trends, detect anomalies, and predict future issues. This is crucial for improving operational efficiency and planning system scaling.
