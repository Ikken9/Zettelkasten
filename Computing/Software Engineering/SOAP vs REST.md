# SOAP vs REST

Many legacy systems may still adhere to [[SOAP]], while [[REST]] came later and is often viewed as a faster alternative in web-based scenarios. REST is a set of guidelines that offers flexible implementation, whereas SOAP is a protocol with specific requirements like XML messaging.

REST APIs are lightweight, making them ideal for newer contexts like the [[Internet of Things (IoT)]], mobile application development, and serverless computing. SOAP web services offer built-in security and transaction compliance that align with many enterprise needs, but that also makes them heavier. Additionally, many public APIs, like the Google Maps API, follow the REST guidelines.
