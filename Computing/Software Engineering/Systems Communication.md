# Systems Communication

**Systems communication** refers to the mechanisms and protocols that allow different software systems, components, or modules to interact and exchange data. These interactions can take place between various layers of a system (such as between client and server, or between microservices) or between different software systems altogether. Effective systems communication is crucial for enabling interoperability, data sharing, and coordinated functionality in complex software architectures.


### **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**
IPC refers to communication between different processes that may be running on the same machine or across different machines. Each process has its own memory space, so IPC allows processes to exchange data, signals, or control information.
Common IPC mechanisms include **shared memory**, **message queues**, **semaphores**, **pipes**, and **sockets**.

**Use Cases**: IPC is often used in distributed systems, multitasking environments, and systems where components run independently and need to coordinate.

### **Client-Server Communication**
This is a model where one system (the client) requests resources or services from another system (the server). The server processes the request and sends back a response.
Communication typically happens over protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, or [[gRPC]]. [[API|APIs]] ([[REST]], [[SOAP]] or [[GraphQL]]) are often used to structure the communication.

**Use Cases**: Web applications, cloud services, and mobile apps often use this model to communicate with backend services.

### **Message Passing**
Message passing involves sending and receiving messages between systems or components, often asynchronously. This decouples the sender and receiver, allowing systems to communicate without direct dependencies.
Popular systems for message passing include message brokers like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, and MQTT. Message passing is often used in [[Architectural Paradigms#Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)|event-driven architectures (EDA)]].

**Use Cases**: Microservices architectures, real-time data streaming, and asynchronous task processing.

### **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**
RPC allows one system or component to execute a procedure (function) on another system as if it were a local call. This abstracts the underlying communication mechanism.
Popular implementations include [[gRPC]], XML-RPC, and JSON-RPC.

**Use Cases**: RPC is widely used in distributed systems where services need to invoke actions on remote servers or services, such as in cloud-based applications or [[Architectural Paradigms#Microservices architecture|microservices]].

### **Middleware**
Middleware is software that sits between systems or components to facilitate communication. It handles tasks like message formatting, security, and routing.
Middleware can include enterprise service buses (ESBs), [[API Gateway|API gateways]], and messaging systems that help systems communicate more effectively.

**Use Cases**: Middleware is often used in large enterprise systems where multiple different subsystems need to communicate, such as in [[Architectural Paradigms#Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)|service-oriented architectures (SOA)]].

### **Event-Driven Communication**
Event-driven communication involves the production, detection, and reaction to events. Systems emit events when something significant happens, and other systems or components react to those events asynchronously.

**Use Cases**: Microservices often use event-driven communication to remain decoupled while still responding to state changes across the system.
