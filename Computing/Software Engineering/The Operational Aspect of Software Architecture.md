# The Operational Aspect of Software Architecture 

**Operational modeling** is an approach for making and capturing decisions about the operational architecture of a computer system. When you create an operational model, you describe the system at a high level of abstraction, specifying how the components of the application are organized and connected, where they will be located and hosted, and what business requirements the application will resolve. You do not specify any technology-specific details about the application or infrastructure, such as which operating system is used or what brand of application server is used. Topologies that deal with this level of abstraction are calledÂ logical models.

You can use any type of units in your logical model, but the following operational modeling units are useful for representing high-level concepts in logical models:

**Location**: 
- A physical, geographic place or a zone of security

**Actor**
- A person or external computer system that interacts with the system, such as a customer, administrator, or employee

**Component**
- A deployable unit of software

**Node**
- The infrastructure that is required to run, install, or deploy a component or other software

**Deployment unit**
- A facet of an application component, but not an independent, executable application.
