# Traditional vs. Agile

**Traditional** and [[Agile Development|Agile]] software development methodologies represent two different approaches to managing and executing software projects. These approaches vary in terms of process structure, flexibility, team dynamics, and focus on customer collaboration.


## **Project Structure and Phases**

| Traditional (Waterfall)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Agile                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Follows a linear approach, with distinct phases such as **requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance**. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, and going back to a previous phase is difficult. | Is cyclical and iterative, with the project being broken down into small, manageable units called **sprints** (typically 1â€“4 weeks). Each sprint results in a potentially shippable product increment. |
| Each phase has defined start and end points, with progress typically measured in terms of completion of phases.                                                                                                                                         | Continuous feedback and adaptation. Instead of following rigid phases, development, testing, and revisions happen concurrently within short iterations.                                                |
| The process relies heavily on comprehensive documentation. Every requirement, design decision, and process step is documented in detail before coding begins.                                                                                           | Prioritizes working software over exhaustive documentation, with an emphasis on just enough documentation to meet current needs.                                                                       |


## **Requirements Gathering**

| Traditional                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Agile                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In traditional development, requirements are gathered in the early stages of the project, often documented in a detailed project plan or specification. Once finalized, these requirements are typically **fixed**, and changes are discouraged. | Agile development embraces change. Requirements can evolve based on feedback from customers and stakeholders during the project lifecycle. Each sprint involves revisiting and refining requirements based on current priorities. |


## **Customer Involvement**

| Traditional                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Agile                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minimal Customer Involvement. Customer involvement is typically concentrated in the beginning (during the requirements phase) and at the end (during delivery). Once the project starts, customers may not see the product until it is fully built and tested. | Customers or product owners are engaged in sprint reviews, planning sessions, and daily meetings (in some frameworks), providing real-time feedback on delivered features. |
| Communication with the customer is often through formal documents and progress reports, rather than ongoing collaboration.                                                                                                                                     | Agile teams maintain open lines of communication with customers, allowing for fast iterations based on their needs and feedback.                                           |


## **Testing and QA**

| Traditional                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Agile                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In traditional models like Waterfall, testing typically takes place after the development phase is complete. This means bugs or issues may not be discovered until late in the project, which can lead to costly delays and revisions. | Testing happens throughout the development process. Code is tested during each sprint, and the product is continuously validated for functionality, ensuring quicker identification of bugs or defects. |



## **When to Use Each Approach**

**Traditional**:
- Best for projects where requirements are well-defined, stable, and unlikely to change (e.g., government contracts, large enterprise projects).
- Suitable for industries or sectors where documentation, compliance, and regulation are critical.

**Agile**:
- Ideal for projects with dynamic or evolving requirements (e.g., startups, web applications, mobile apps).
- Works well in environments where customer feedback is essential and the product must evolve based on user feedback (e.g., software-as-a-service or rapidly changing industries).
