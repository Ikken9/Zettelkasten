# Capacitive Voltage Divider

A capacitive voltage divider is one kind of voltage divider circuit where [[Capacitor|capacitors]] are used as the voltage-dividing components. Similar to resistors, capacitors can also be used to form a voltage divider circuit so that voltage can be separated into parts of a circuit based on the capacitor value. Similar to a voltage divider circuit using resistors, capacitors are connected in series to form a voltage divider network with a voltage source.
