#### Power Supply Smoothing
One of the most common and fundamental applications of a capacitor is in power supply smoothing. By placing a large electrolytic capacitor in parallel with the output of a rectifier, the capacitor compensates for the fluctuations in the rectified AC waveform, resulting in a relatively smooth DC output. The capacitor achieves this by charging during the voltage peaks and discharging during the intervals between these peaks. However, as the load increases, the capacitor discharges more rapidly, leading to a higher ripple in the output voltage.

#### Timing
Capacitors play a crucial role in timing circuits. When a capacitor is charged through a resistor, the charging process takes a finite amount of time. Similarly, when a resistive load is connected to a charged capacitor, the capacitor takes time to discharge. During the charging phase, the capacitor initially behaves like a short circuit, but once fully charged, it acts as an open circuit.

#### Filtering
Capacitors are also used in filtering applications. When DC voltage is applied to a capacitor, it charges and subsequently blocks any further current flow. However, when an AC signal is applied, the capacitor allows current to flow. The amount of current that flows depends on both the frequency of the AC signal and the capacitance value.


### What Size Capacitor Should You Use?

Selecting an appropriately-sized capacitor can be challenging. The selection of the capacitor should take into account the capacitance, voltage rating, ripple current rating, and temperature. The physical size of the capacitance is influenced by the variation in each of these parameters, and the variation in size is different for each capacitor type, including paper capacitors, mica capacitors, ceramic capacitors, and electrolytic capacitors.

#### Tantalum Capacitors

**Maximum ESR for tantalum capacitors is specified at 100kHz**, as this is fairly close to the switching frequency of most power supplies, while ceramics are typically not specified or are given for resonant frequency only.
