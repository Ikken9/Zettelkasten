# Capacitance

In electromagnetism and electronics, the **capacitance** is the capability of a material object to store electric charge. It is measured by the charge in response to a difference in electric potential, expressed as the ratio of those quantities.

Commonly recognized are two closely related notions of capacitance: _self capacitance_ and _mutual capacitance_. An object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance, for which the electric potential is measured between the object and ground. Mutual capacitance is measured between two components, and is particularly important in the operation of the **capacitor**, an elementary linear electronic component designed to add capacitance to an electric circuit.

The capacitance between two conductors is a function only of the geometry; the opposing surface area of the conductors and the distance between them, and the permittivity of any dielectric material between them. For many dielectric materials, the permittivity, and thus the capacitance, is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.
