# Filter

An **RF Filter** is a type of electronic filter used to allow or block specific frequency ranges in a radio frequency spectrum. It plays a crucial role in various RF systems, such as communication devices, transmitters, receivers, and more. RF filters are designed to operate at high frequencies (ranging from a few kHz to several GHz) and can be used to improve signal quality, reduce noise, and prevent interference.

### Types of RF Filters:
1. **Low-Pass Filter**: Allows signals with frequencies lower than a certain cutoff frequency to pass through and attenuates signals higher than this frequency.
2. **High-Pass Filter**: Allows frequencies higher than a specific cutoff frequency to pass through and blocks lower frequencies.
3. **Band-Pass Filter**: Passes a specific range of frequencies while attenuating signals outside this range.
4. **Band-Stop (or Notch) Filter**: Blocks or attenuates a particular frequency range while allowing frequencies outside this range to pass through.
