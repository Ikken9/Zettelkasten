# Modulation

Baseband signals are information signals at their original frequencies, typically low frequencies. Wireless communication systems typically will *upshift* the frequency spectrum of baseband signals to a higher range of frequencies to allow transmission through the atmosphere. This high frequency for wireless signal transmission is called the carrier frequency, and the process to shift the baseband signals to carrier frequency is called RF **modulation**.
