# Radio Frequency Modulation

Modulation is the process of encoding information onto a carrier wave by altering its basic properties, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase.

[[Baseband]] signals are information signals at their original frequencies, typically low frequencies. Wireless communication systems typically will *upshift* the frequency spectrum of baseband signals to a higher range of frequencies to allow transmission through the atmosphere. This high frequency for wireless signal transmission is called the carrier frequency, and the process to shift the baseband signals to carrier frequency is called RF **modulation**.

Since the carrier frequency is at a higher range than baseband signal frequency, the RF modulation process is also referred to as the "*upconversion*".
