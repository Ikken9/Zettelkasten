# Signal Amplitude

Amplitude refers to the maximum height of a radio wave, measured from the baseline to the peak of the waveform. Amplitude is directly related to the power of an RF signal; the greater the amplitude, the more power the waveform carries at a given point in time.

The SI unit for measuring amplitude depends on the type of wave or signal being measured. Here are a few examples:

1. Mechanical Waves (e.g., sound waves): The amplitude is often measured in meters ($m$) for displacement or decibels ($dB$) for sound intensity.
2. Electromagnetic Waves (e.g., light waves): The amplitude can be measured in meters ($m$) for electric field strength or watts per square meter ($W/m²$) for intensity.
3. Electrical Signals: The amplitude of voltage signals is typically measured in volts ($V$).

As the amplitude represents the signal power/strength when referring to RF signals, it is often measured in Watts ($W$)
