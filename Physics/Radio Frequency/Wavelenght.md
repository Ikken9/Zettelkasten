# Wavelenght

The wavelength of a wave describes how long the wave is. The distance from the "crest" (top) of one wave to the crest of the next wave is the wavelength. Alternately, we can measure from the "trough" (bottom) of one wave to the trough of the next wave and get the same value for the wavelength.

It can be calculated as:

$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$$
where $c$ is the speed of light, and $f$ the frequency.
